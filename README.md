This is my personal portfolio documenting different projects that I had worked on. It documents most of the projects that I have worked (and is currently working) on, giving a basic overview into what I can do as a creator and coder :)

(Created using HTML and CSS, hoping to add JavaScript in later.)

To-do list:
- fix footer
- make the website look nicer when on different devices
- finish adding links & fix icon pictures
- add more interactiveness (w/ javascript)
