This is my personal portfolio documenting different projects that I had worked on. It documents most of the projects that I have worked (and is currently working) on, giving a basic overview into what I can do as a creator and coder :)

(Created using HTML and CSS, hoping to add JavaScript in later.)

<h2>To-do list:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>make the website look nicer when on different devices</li>
  <li>add more interactiveness (w/ javascript)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>changing title sequence so it says hello/welcome in different languages</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
